  schema:content """we present Genesis, a generic RDF data access interface. Genesis can be deployed on top of any knowledge base and search engine with minimal effort and allows for the representation of RDF data in a layperson-friendly way. This is facilitated by the modular architecture for reusable components underlying our framework. Currently, these include a generic search back-end, together with corresponding interactive user interface components based on a service for similar and related entities as well as verbalization services to bridge between RDF and natural language""" ;

Metadata portals offer access to Open Data, which
is increasingly published on the basis of RDF vocabularies and
ontologies. Individual datasets include URIs and descriptions of
licenses under which the datasets are published. Licenses can be
defined by attributes of the types permission, requirement and
prohibition. This demo focuses on the problem of relicensing
datasets that include multiple other open datasets published
under different licenses. If combined datasets are republished,
a chosen license must comply with the original licenses of each
dataset. The approach is based on mapping licenses to deontic
interpretations and combining them using an OR-composite
operator. The result of the operator is used to determine matching
licenses from a Knowledge Base containing license information.

  schema:content """ I am a computer engineering student interested in improving data reliability and its benefits. I have recently worked on fact-checking related topics, which resulted in the Esther project. Esther is an approach that moves the corroborative path search into the embedding space of a knowledge graph. This enabled the finding of longer paths to corroborate a given statement.
  <p>
  Previously, I have assisted with Lemming project's code-development and evaluation. Given previous versions of a dataset, Lemming generates an artificial knowledge graph of an arbitrary size with the goal of predicting the performance and ranking of storage solutions.

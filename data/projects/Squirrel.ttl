Squirrel is a crawler of Linked Data, in order to exploit all the content of the linked web. 
By ingesting initial seeds, it follows all the links availables and performs a deep search to crawl everything.
Squirrel has a extensible architecture allowing the user to customise the type of content that wants to crawl. 
Thus, it is possible to transform non linked data on RDF graphs. 
With Squirrel, the distributed architecture allows the user adjust the scalability to the needs.
By using its extensive framework, it is possible to create custom components allowing to
convert data not only to RDF serialization, but to any other that can describe a graph relationship.

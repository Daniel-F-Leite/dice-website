title: 'Student Research Assistant as Machine Learning and Hardware Developer'
---

In a former project, we developed a traffic detection system to classify and count pedestrians and cyclists.
The individual project parts are available and have to be combined.
Now we are looking for a student research assistant to assemble the different components listed in the following:

- Hardware board: Jetson TX2 Board (see [board images and screenshots of the Nvidia SDK Manager](https://github.com/dice-group/VEP/wiki/Configuring-the-Project-on-the-Jetson-TX2-Board))
- Hardware case and camera (see image below)
- Software and model: YOLO (Real-Time Object Detection) / PyTorch / TorchVision at [GitHub](https://github.com/dice-group/VEP)

The board, camera, software and model have been tested and were already in a runing state.
Now everything has to be assembled in the hardware case and with batteries.
The final goal is to have a demonstrator to present the system to the city of Paderborn.

We offer a work contract starting with 9 hours/week for 3 month for this project. If you are interested, please send an email to adrian.wilke@upb.de with your CV and motivation letter.
For further information please also contact [Adrian Wilke](/AdrianWilke).

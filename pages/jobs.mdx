## Student Assistants


### C++ developer Position

#### Tasks

Your task will be to support us in the implementation and maintenance of high-impact (research) prototypes. The position allows you to learn about our various research projects on storage and querying (RDF, tensor data) and symbolic machine learning. You will be integrated into a team of experts that has already demonstrated innovative and scalable solutions for many areas of the Semantic Web.

#### Requirements

Students in Bachelor and Master can apply.

In addition to good C++ knowledge, you should be motivated to deepen your C++ skills and to work out solutions to problems independently.
The ability to work in a team is important to us. Nobody writes perfect code on the first try and certainly not alone. Therefore, you should be able to explain your code and assess its strengths and weaknesses.

On the technical side, you should be familiar with build tools like CMake. Using git for version control is part of your daily routine. Optimally, you are also familiar with the configuration of relevant CI/CD solutions in gitlab and github.
Template programming is more for you than setting the key_type of a std::map.

#### We offer

At the beginning you will get a contract of employment with 9 hours per week, which can be increased to 19 hours per week after a few months. The payment is based on the tables for SHK/WHB salaries. Especially interesting for the summer: we offer you an air-conditioned workplace (at the moment unfortunately still with some limitations because of COVID-19. But we are working on it!)

You will work with scientists to develop research prototypes.  This will give you the opportunity to gain experience in collaboration with other programmers, improve your algorithm implementation skills, learn about various projects and frameworks, and get regular feedback on your performance. Often it is also possible to follow up with a bachelor or master theses in the area you are working on.

#### Application

Write an informal mail to bigerl@mail.upb.de with your application until **31.03.2022**. Please let us know about any relevant previous experience. We invite suitable applicants to an assessment.

Applications from women are explicitly encouraged and will be treated with preference in accordance with the LGG in the event of equal aptitude, qualifications and professional performance, unless reasons relating to the person of a competitor outweigh this. The application of suitable disabled persons and people with equivalent status within the meaning of the Ninth Book of the German Social Law Code (SGB IX) is also encouraged.

For more information and application until 31.03.2022 please contact [Alexander Bigerl](/AlexanderBigerl).

<!-- Text if no SHK job is available:

We offer student assistant positions to work with us on research and teaching projects (SHK/WHB with up to 19h/week). Available positions will be listed here. Applications can be submitted to [Michael Röder](/MichaelRoeder). We are looking forward to hearing from you!

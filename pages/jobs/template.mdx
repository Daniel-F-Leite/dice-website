- **TODO**: Edit the **title** in the **metadata** of this file.  
  It should contain as special information as possible (e.g. *Student assistant position: Java developer in the ReCoDa project*)
- **TODO**: Edit the **filename** of this file.  
  It should contain the most important information. Prefer CamelCase and dashes '-' (e.g. *StudentAssistant-Java-ReCoDa.mdx*).


### Tasks and Insights

**TODO**: Edit/remove the contents below. Include the main tasks and give enough insights to have a good impression on upcoming works (repositories, main issues, papers, ...).

- You will start with **generating a Knowledge Graph** for licenses which will be implemented in **Java**.  
  See: [GitHub Issue: *Check licenses for Datasets and Distributions*](https://github.com/projekt-opal/licenses/issues/1).
- Additional tasks are highly related to the **ReCoDa article Java code**.  
  See: [Code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dice-group/ReCoDa)
- You will mainly develop **Java** software components related to **RDF triples**.  
  See: [Learn RDF - Semantic Web learning resources](https://dice-research.org/news/2022-07-26_Learn-RDF/).
- Your work relates primarily to the article [Relicensing Combined Datasets](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSC50631.2021.00050) (available via [UPB VPN](https://imt.uni-paderborn.de/en/vpn-access)).
- There are **additional open tasks** in the OPAL research project.  
  See: [OPAL project](https://dice-research.org/OPAL) and [ReCoDa demo](https://dice-research.org/ReCoDa).


### Requirements

**TODO**: Edit/remove the contents below

- Students in **Bachelor** and **Master** can apply.
- In addition to good **Java** knowledge, you should be motivated to deepen your programming skills and to work out solutions to problems independently.
- It is advantageous if you have completed one of our **[courses](https://dice-research.org/students/teaching/)** with a very good result.  
  (e.g. *Semantic Web*, *Statistical Natural Language Processing* or a project group.)
- The ability to work in a **team** is important to us. Nobody writes perfect code on the first try and certainly not alone. Therefore, you should be able to explain your code and assess its strengths and weaknesses.


### We offer

**TODO**: Edit/remove the contents below

* At the beginning you will get a contract of employment with **9 hours per week**, which can be increased to **19 hours per week** after a few months. The payment is based on the tables for SHK/WHB salaries.  
* Especially interesting for the summer: we offer you an **air-conditioned workplace** (at the moment unfortunately still with some limitations because of COVID-19. But we are working on it!). Remote work is, upon arrangement, also possible of course. 
* You will join a **team of experts** that has already demonstrated innovative and scalable solutions for many areas of the Semantic Web.
* You will work with scientists to develop research prototypes. This will give you the opportunity to **gain experience** in collaboration with other programmers, improve your algorithm implementation skills, learn about various projects and frameworks, and get regular feedback on your performance. Often it is also possible to follow up with a bachelor or master theses in the area you are working on.


### Application

**TODO**: Edit/remove the contents below

* Write an **informal mail** to [Alexander Bigerl](/AlexanderBigerl).  
  For more information and application please also use the contact above.
* Please let us know about any relevant previous experience.
* We may invite suitable applicants to an assessment afterwards.
* Applications from women are explicitly encouraged and will be treated with preference in accordance with the LGG in the event of equal aptitude, qualifications and professional performance, unless reasons relating to the person of a competitor outweigh this. The application of suitable disabled persons and people with equivalent status within the meaning of the Ninth Book of the German Social Law Code (SGB IX) is also encouraged.

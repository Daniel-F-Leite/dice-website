We are happy to present the first version of [ScholarBrew](https://s2.exynize.com/) - our attempt to provide better insights into scholarly data using various visualisations.

The current demo features core data taken from [Semantic Scholar dataset](http://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/). Due to quality issues with organizations gathered by Semantic Scholar, we had to perform additional steps to get satisfiable results. First, we’ve merged the core dataset with [CiteSeerX dataset](http://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/about/data) to get better author affiliations. Then we’ve used [FOX](http://aksw.org/Projects/FOX.html) to clean up organizations, as Semantic Scholar dataset frequently has more than one organization mentioned in one “name”. After the basic cleanup, we used the [OSM Names](https://github.com/OSMNames/OSMNames) dataset to get locations for all extracted organizations.

This resulted in 7210983 papers with 8303571 authors and 5382618 organizations in our dataset.

ScholarBrew provides search by organizations, authors or keywords as well as faceted search that allows users to mix-and-match those entities.

Entity pages - be it organization, author or keyword - feature basic data about entities (such as h-index, affiliation, number of papers and related entities), heatmap visualisation of related locations (figure 1), top related co-authors, top related organizations as well as a list of articles.

Additionally ScholarBrew provides a global statistic visualisation page. Currently it features a way to see the distribution of the h-index of all organizations included in the dataset - viewed either over the whole world, or limited to a user-defined country. You can see the example visualisation for the whole world in figure 2 below.

This is the demo of the first stage of ScholarBrew. In the upcoming release we are planning to introduce a “hot topics” feature that will use machine learning techniques to predict and highlight research topics that are currently trending among researchers.

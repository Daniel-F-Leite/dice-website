**DICE organizes 3 challenges and 2 workshops at the Extended Semantic Web Conference 2018**

### Scalable Question Answering

After successfully organizing the QALD-7 challenge at the ESWC 2017 and the QALD-8 challenge (incorporated in the NLIWoD workshop at ISWC 2017) the HOBBIT project ([https://project-hobbit.eu/](https://project-hobbit.eu/)) is proud to announce the Scalable Question Answering Open Challenge (SQA) over Linked Data. SQA Open Challenge will run periodically with cutoff dates in June 2018 at ESWC 2018!

Stay tuned and get ready to participate!

Monetary prizes will be given to the best winning systems at each cutoff date. Please express your interest in the SQA Open Challenge by adding your email via  [https://project-hobbit.eu/open-challenges/sqa-open-challenge/express-interest/](https://project-hobbit.eu/open-challenges/sqa-open-challenge/express-interest/). You will receive further information and notifications regarding the progress of the SQA Open Challenge.

### OKE

The [HOBBIT project](https://project-hobbit.eu/) is happy to inform you that the Open Knowledge Extraction Challenge was accepted for the fourth time at the [ESWC](https://2018.eswc-conferences.org/). The aim of OKE is to test the performance of knowledge extraction systems in aspects that are relevant for the Semantic Web. These include precision, recall and runtime. The challenge will test the systems within the HOBBIT platform against data derived from several sources. This year, the 4th OKE Challenge consists of two tasks from the last challenge and two new tasks comprising Named Entity Identification, Linking and Disambiguation as well as Relation Extraction.

Training data and challenge Call for Papers will be ready on Monday February 12th, 2018. The results of the OKE 2018 will be found on the [HOBBIT benchmarking platform](http://master.project-hobbit.eu/home).

Stay tuned and get ready to participate!

### MOCHA

After the successful run of the 1st MOCHA challenge in ESWC 2017, the HOBBIT project is proud to announce the 2nd Mighty Storage Challenge (MOCHA 2018) at ISWC 2018. Triple stores are the backbone of most applications based on Linked Data. Hence, devising systems that achieve a good performance on real datasets and real loads is of central importance for the practical applicability of Semantic Web technologies. So far, it is only partly known whether we have already passed this cap. With this challenge, we aim to:

- provide objective measures for how well current systems (including 3 commercial systems, which have already expressed their desire to participate) perform on real tasks of industrial relevance and 
- detect bottlenecks in existing systems to further their development towards practical usage. 

The results of the MOCHA 2018 will be found on the[ HOBBIT benchmarking platform](http://master.project-hobbit.eu/home).

## **Workshops**

### Geospatial Linked Data (GeoLD)

Abstract: Geospatial data is vital for many application scenarios, such as navigation, logistics, and tourism. At the same time, a large number of currently available datasets (both RDF and conventional) contain geospatial information. The goal of the GeoLD workshop is to provide an opportunity for the Linked Data community to focus on the emerging need for effective and efficient production, management and utilization of Geospatial information within Linked Data. Emphasis will be given to works describing novel methodologies, algorithms and tools that advance the current state of the art with respect to efficiency or effectiveness. We welcome both mature solutions, as well as ongoing works that present promising results.

### QuWeDa 2018: 2nd Workshop on Querying the Web of Data

The constant growth of Linked Open Data (LOD) on the Web opens new challenges pertaining to querying such massive amounts of publicly available data. LOD datasets are available through various interfaces, such as data dumps, SPARQL endpoints and triple pattern fragments. In addition, various sources produce streaming data. Efficiently querying these sources is of central importance for the scalability of Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies. The trend of publicly available and interconnected data is shifting the focus of Web technologies towards new paradigms of Linked Data querying. To exploit the massive amount of LOD data to its full potential, users should be able to query and combine this data easily and effectively. This workshop at the [Extended Semantic Web Conference 2018 (ESWC 2018)](https://2018.eswc-conferences.org/) seeks original articles describing theoretical and practical methods and techniques for fostering, querying, and consuming the Data Web.

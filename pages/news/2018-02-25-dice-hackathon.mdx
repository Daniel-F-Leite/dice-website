We sought to bring colleagues from cross-functional semantic web subdomains together and give them a platform to realize their own fresh ideas. A hackathon was the perfect playground for discovery, where participants had the opportunity to get to know each other better, take on new roles, and break out of their daily routines.

On Wednesday, February 21, 2018, we had the first DICE hackathon at the University of Paderborn. About 12 people took part in our first hackathon, enjoyed the Pizzas, joined several discussions and realized that coding doesnâ€™t need to be a lonely activity.

Stay tuned for the results of this Hackathon and maybe join us next time!

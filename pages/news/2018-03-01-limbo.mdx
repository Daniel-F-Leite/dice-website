Close to the end of the 8th month of its development, [LIMBO](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/projects/active-projects/limbo/) is pacing forward to take mobility data out of oblivion. Rightly standing up to its name, [LIMBO](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/projects/active-projects/limbo/) elevates available mobility data out of the limbo state of unstructuredness and non-connectivity, to meaningful and structured data that can be employed in a variety of scenarios.

The [DICE](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/about/) group is a major stakeholder in this collaborative development. Pitching into data integration and fusion, [DICE](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/about/) has a versatile palette of artifacts to offer. The development here at [DICE](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/about/) has firm grounds with the state of the art rather than just being exploratory. [DICE](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/about/) is implementing and extending the data fusion/integration, data elevation/enrichment and keyword/question answering search for the initial use cases around [mCloud](https://www.mcloud.de/).

It begins with [FOX](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/projects/active-projects/fox/) - a Named Entity Recognition framework, which administers the federation of RDF extraction from unstructured text. This brings [DEER](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/projects/active-projects/deer/) - RDF Data Enrichment Framework, to focus on the data enrichment, which pops [LIMES ](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/projects/active-projects/limes/)- Link Discovery Framework for Metric Spaces, into the limelight for data fusion. Moreover, we are developing [Squirrel](https://github.com/dice-group/Squirrel) - a Linked Data Crawler, for exploring the Web of Data for more useful mobility resources. These artifacts ensure data elevation, enrichment, fusion, and integration, hence deploying an orchestrated data breeding concept. Finally, the ball lands in the field of search and dataset search. Questions are to be answered, things have to be searched! Finally, technologies based on [HAWK](http://aksw.org/projects/hawk) will fly through the [mCloud](https://www.mcloud.de/) and fetch all the answers for the user.

Though it is too early to predict the cohesion and collision between the different integration components that [DICE](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/about/) has to offer, we proceed with the positive certainty that all good parts when brought together can yield better results and best impact!

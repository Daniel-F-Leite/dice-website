The research project SOLIDE visited the Hamm fire brigade, on 26.04.2018. In addition to an extensive introduction to the fire brigade, which was important for the orientation of the research teams, sounds were filtered out in the voice recording and the simulation of a radio dialogue was recorded.

In the research project SOLIDE, we are examining a new approach for efficient access to operational data using the command mission management software TecBos Command. The focus here is on the fact that information can be accessed in a natural language dialogue. For this purpose, we do research into subject-specific algorithms for filtering relevant knowledge as well as suitable data integration procedures  to make the available data usable and retrievable via dialogues.

For the support of the research project offered by the Hamm Fire Department, we thank them very sincerely!

The research project SOLIDE is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

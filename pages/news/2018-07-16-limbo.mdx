The third LIMBO ([https://www.limbo-project.org/](https://www.limbo-project.org/)) face to face meeting happened on June 20th in Berlin at BMVI, the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.

The accompanying WIK workshop ([http://www.wik.org/index.php?id=1029](http://www.wik.org/index.php?id=1029)) offered mFUND projects the opportunity to compare and discuss their (planned) database architectures in a benchmarking workshop. The aim of the workshop was, on the one hand, a constructive dialogue between the mFUND projects. On the other hand, it provided the opportunity to discuss common challenges and solutions - in the hope of mutual benefit for the work of the mFUND projects. The target group of the workshop was the database experts of the projects. Dr. Usbeck and Prof. Ngonga, as well as Dr. Wauer (OPAL project), took part. During the workshop, six projects presented their database architecture in short presentations. Many other projects were interested in LIMBO's and OPAL's underlying Linked Data architecture.

In the afternoon, the LIMBO consortium discussed the current state of its work packages as well as future collaboration steps to drive the quality assurance.

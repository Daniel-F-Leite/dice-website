The goal of this thesis was to ﬁnd entities in a large set of archival data and to link those entities to the knowledgebases GND ([http://www.dnb.de/DE/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html](http://www.dnb.de/DE/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html)) and Wikidata ([https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)). For the task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) a Conditional Random Field was used and the linking was implemented with a extension of AGDISTIS ([http://aksw.org/Projects/AGDISTIS.html](http://aksw.org/Projects/AGDISTIS.html)).

The extension of AGDISTIS contains a new measure for calculating the distance of two entities and new entitytype speciﬁc features. On top of that a new technique was developed to link entities over two knowledgebases at the same time. Finally the framework was evaluated with a newly generated gold standard for archival data.

The LIMES development team is happy to announce [LIMES 1.5.0](https://github.com/dice-group/LIMES/releases/tag/1.5.0)! [LIMES](http://aksw.org/Projects/LIMES) is a link discovery framework for the Web of Data, which implements time-efficient approaches for large-scale link discovery. While it was originally based only on the characteristics of metric spaces — which was eponymous for the framework — it now employs a broad spectrum of optimizations at different steps of the pipeline in order to link those knowledge bases even faster.

Our framework provides a user-friendly graphical user interface as well as several machine learning algorithms for enabling an easy configuration of the link discovery task. For more in-depth details about LIMES, see our previous [blog post](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/news/news-single/news/limes-a-framework-for-link-discovery-on-the-semantic-web/?tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&cHash=1c213afd802225e4a379bfb77bb33d01). The new release includes the following updates:

- Refactored preprocessing implementation that enables complex preprocessing functions that operate on more than one field. You can [read about it](http://dice-group.github.io/LIMES/user_manual/configuration_file/#data-sources)
- Reworked [user manual](http://dice-group.github.io/LIMES/user_manual/) with the goal to make it easier to read for newcomers
- Several bug fixes

You can get the newest release [here](https://github.com/dice-group/LIMES/releases/tag/1.3.0). Stay tuned for our next LIMES releases!

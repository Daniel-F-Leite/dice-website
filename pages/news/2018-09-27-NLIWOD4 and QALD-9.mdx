We are organizing a joint workshop, [NLIWOD4 and QALD-9](http://2018.nliwod.org/), in the domain of interaction paradigms to Linked Data at the 17th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) on 9th October 2018 in Monterey, California, USA. NLIWOD (Natural Language Interfaces to the Web of Data) in its fourth iteration at ISWC will focus on soliciting discussions on the development of question answering systems. QALD, a benchmarking campaign of question answering over linked data, powered by the H2020 project HOBBIT (project-hobbit.eu), offers a challenge - QALD-9 - in which the users will be demonstrating the capabilities of their systems using the given online benchmark platform.

The workshop will commence with a keynote presentation by [Peter F. Patel-Schneider](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-f-patel-schneider-5a65b848) on Connecting Industrial NL Applications to Knowledge (in Nuance), followed by talks on Extensible Natural-Language Query Interface to an Event-Based Semantic Web and Chatbot: Who Wants to Learn the Knowledge: KB-Agent. After a short break, it will resume with an overview and evaluation of the QALD 9 Challenge followed by the talks on Open Relation Extraction by Matrix Factorization and Universal Schemas and Testing a Knowledge Inquiry System on Question Answering, which has also been awarded as the best paper of the workshop.

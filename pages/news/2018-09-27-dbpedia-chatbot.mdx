[DBpedia Chatbot](http://chat.dbpedia.org/) is a conversational agent for DBpedia which is capable of responding to users in the form of simple short text messages or through more elaborate interactive messages. It can be accessed via a Web Interface, Slack or by Facebook Messenger.

The bot can engage in casual conversation/banter and answer both factual questions and questions related to DBpedia. It can also expose the research work being done in DBpedia as product features.

Users can ask questions like, Who is Obama?, Where is the Eiffel Tower?, Is DBpedia down?, What is DBpedia?, Where can I find the mapping tool?, How are you doing? and so on. Go on and try [it](http://chat.dbpedia.org/) out yourself!

The chatbot focuses on resolving three main challenges. First, understanding the query presented by the user, second, fetching relevant information based on the query through DBpedia or other sources and finally, tailoring the responses based on the standards of each platform and developing subsequent user interactions with the Chatbot.

Currently the German Federal Computer Science Competition (“Bundeswettbewerb Informatik”) [ follow the link for more information: [https://bwinf.de/bundeswettbewerb/der-36-bwinf/endrunde/](https://bwinf.de/bundeswettbewerb/der-36-bwinf/endrunde/) ] is in its final round at the University of Paderborn (UPB).  The aim of the competition is to arouse young people's interest in computer science, and to detect and promote their talents. It is aimed at students still in Highschool. Currently, the 30 most talented of these pupils compete for first place.

In the context of the event, groups of UPB’s computer science department gave an overview of their cutting edge research, and as part of it, the DICE group introduced foundations and use cases of the Semantic Web. To provide the pupils with a profound insight into the work of the DICE group, we presented a student project group work, a master’s thesis topic, and a current research area.

Adrian Wilke introduced the pupils to some basic concepts like Linked Data and RDF. Next, Kevin Haack, a student, gave an introduction into a 1st year student’s project and his practical experience with data science research tools. Zafar Syed talked about his paper “FactCheck - Validating triples using textual evidence” [ [https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2018/CIKM_FACTCHECK/public.pdf](https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2018/CIKM_FACTCHECK/public.pdf) ], that was based on his master’s thesis and was accepted at the CIKM18 conference. The pupils learned how facts can be validated or invalidated against a collection of documents. Lastly, Alexander Bigerl introduced graph stores for RDF data and gave a brief overview of using Tensor Algebra for data manipulation.

The pupils were very interested and asked many insightful and profound questions.

We wish them good luck for the ongoing competition and hope to see many of them in our lectures at the UPB.

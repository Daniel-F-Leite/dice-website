At the 21st International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW), René Speck will present his research “On Extracting Relations using Distributional Semantics and a Tree Generalization”.

Extracting relations out of unstructured text is essential for a wide range of applications. Minimal human effort, scalability and high precision are desirable characteristics. We introduce a distant supervised closed relation extraction approach based on distributional semantics and a tree generalization. Our approach uses training data obtained from a reference knowledge base to derive dependency parse trees that might express a relation. It then uses a novel generalization algorithm to construct dependency tree patterns for the relation. Distributional semantics are used to eliminate false candidate patterns. We evaluate the performance in experiments on a large corpus using ninety target relations. Our evaluation results suggest that our approach achieves a higher precision than two state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, our results also underpin the scalability of our approach. Our open source implementation can be found at github.com/dice-group/Ocelot.

With our contribution we push forward the quality of relation extraction and thus the quality of applications in areas such as Knowledge Base Population and Semantic Question Answering. Moreover, we provide the source-code of our approach together with the version numbers of all utilized tools and all settings as well as the datasets used in this paper. We have now integrated the results of this work, the generalized trees, into the Fox framework, a demo can be found at fox-demo.aksw.de. The main advantages of this framework are that it is open source, and provides additional features such as named entity recognition and disambiguation, linked data by several RDF serialisations and a freely usable RESTful web service that is ready to use by the community. We have now provided a system for knowledge extraction out of unstructured text that presents the extracted entities and relations in a machine readable format to the community.

We are very pleased to announce that HOBBIT presented 7 papers and organized a workshop at ISWC 2018, which was held on 8-12 October, 2018 in Monterey, USA.

The International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) is the premier international forum where Semantic Web / Linked Data researchers, practitioners, and industry specialists come together to discuss, advance, and shape the future of semantic technologies on the web, within enterprises and in the context of the public institution.

Here are the details of the papers and workshop presented by HOBBIT:

“[LARGERDFBENCH: A BILLION TRIPLES BENCHMARK FOR SPARQL ENDPOINT FEDERATION](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1570826817300719?token=468874A98581A8C12A98251C710FDA80F03A9C5E91FACFDBE9769D0B2754CCFDC80F81974C38F5B320F4C545DDDB5C70)” by Muhammad Saleem, Ali Hasnain, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo, presented at ISWC Journal track.

Abstract: Gathering information from the distributed Web of Data is commonly carried out by using SPARQL query federation approaches. However, the fitness of current SPARQL query federation approaches for real applications is difficult to evaluate with current benchmarks as they are either synthetic, too small in size and complexity or do not provide means for a fine-grained evaluation. We propose LargeRDFBench, a billion-triple benchmark for SPARQL query federation which encompasses real data as well as real queries pertaining to real bio-medical use cases. We evaluate state-of-the-art SPARQL endpoint federation approaches on this benchmark with respect to their query runtime, triple pattern-wise source selection, number of endpoints requests, and result completeness and correctness. Our evaluation results suggest that the performance of current SPARQL query federation systems on simple queries (in terms of total triple patterns, query result set sizes, execution time, use of SPARQL features etc.) does not reflect the systems' performance on more complex queries. Moreover, current federation systems seem unable to deal with real queries that involve processing large intermediate result sets or lead to large result sets.

“[GENERATING SPARQL QUERY CONTAINMENT BENCHMARKS USING THE SQCFRAMEWORK](https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2018/ISWC-Demo-SQCFramework/public.pdf)” by Muhammad Saleem, Qaiser Mehmood, Claus Stadler, Jens Lehmann and Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo, presented at ISWC demo track.

Abstract: In this demo paper, we present the interface of the SQCFrameWork, a SPARQL query containment benchmark generation framework. SQCFrameWork is able to generate customized SPARQL containment benchmarks from real SPARQL query logs. To this end, the framework makes use of the different clustering techniques. It is flexible enough to generate benchmarks of varying sizes and complexities according to user-defined criteria on important SPARQL features for query containment benchmarking. We evaluate the usability of the interface by using the standard system usability scale questionnaire. Our overall usability score of 82.33 suggests that the online interface is consistent, easy to use, and the various functions of the system are well integrated.

“[EXTENDING LARGERDFBENCH FOR MULTI-SOURCE DATA AT SCALE FOR SPARQL ENDPOINT FEDERATION](https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2018/ISWC-Satellite-ExtendedLargeRDFBench/public.pdf)”

Ali Hasnain, Muhammad Saleem, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo, and Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann, presented at 12th International Workshop on Scalable Semantic Web Knowledge Base Systems (SSWS), co-located with ISWC 2018. This paper was also selected as one of the best workshop’s papers to be published at an ISWC satellite event.

Abstract: Querying the Web of Data is highly motivated by the use of federation approaches (mainly SPARQL query federation) when the data is available through endpoints. Different benchmarks have been proposed to exploit the full potential of SPARQL query federation approaches in real world scenarios with their limitations in size and complexity. Previously, we introduced LargeRDFBench - a billion-triple benchmark for SPARQL query federation. In this work, we pinpoint some of the limitations of LargeRDFBench and propose an extension with 8 additional queries. Our evaluation results of the state-of-the-art federation engines revealed interesting insights, when tested on these additional queries.

"[Introducing the HOBBIT platform into the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Campaign](http://disi.unitn.it/~pavel/om2018/papers/om2018_LTpaper5.pdf)"  Jiménez-Ruiz, E., Saveta, T., Zamazal, O., Hertling, S., Röder, M., Fundulaki, I., Ngomo, A.-C.N., Sherif, M.A., Annane, A., and others, presented at Ontology Matching (OM) workshop.  
 
Abstract: This paper describes the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative 2017.5 pre-campaign. Like in 2012, when we transitioned the evaluation to the SEALS platform, we have also conducted a pre-campaign to assess the feasibility of moving to the HOBBIT platform. We report the experiences of this pre-campaign and discuss the future steps for the OAEI. 

"[SPgen: A Benchmark Generator for Spatial Link Discovery Tools](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-00671-6_24.pdf)"

Tzanina Saveta, Irini Fundulaki, Giorgos Flouris and Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo, presented at ISWC research track.  
 
Abstract:  A number of real and synthetic benchmarks have been proposed for evaluating the performance of link discovery systems. So far, only a limited number of link discovery benchmarks target the problem of linking geo-spatial entities. However, some of the largest knowledge bases of the Linked Open Data Web, such as LinkedGeoData contain vast amounts of spatial information. Several systems that manage spatial data and consider the topology of the spatial resources and the topological relations between them have been developed. In order to assess the ability of these systems to handle the vast amount of spatial data and perform the much needed data integration in the Linked Geo Data Cloud, it is imperative to develop benchmarks for geo-spatial link discovery. In this paper we propose the Spatial Benchmark Generator SPgen that can be used to test the performance of link discovery systems which deal with topological relations as proposed in the state of the art DE-9IM (Dimensionally Extended nine-Intersection Model). SPgen implements all topological relations of DE-9IM between LineStrings and Polygons in the two-dimensional space. A comparative analysis with benchmarks produced using the SPgen to assess and identify the capabilities of AML, OntoIdea, RADON and Silk spatial link discovery systems is provided.

"[EARL: Joint Entity and Relation Linking for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-00671-6_7.pdf)"  Dubey Mohnish Dubey, Debayan Banerjee, Debanjan Chaudhuri and Jens Lehmann, presented at ISWC research track. 

Abstract:  Many question answering systems over knowledge graphs rely on entity and relation linking components in order to connect the natural language input to the underlying knowledge graph. Traditionally, entity linking and relation linking has been performed either as a dependent, sequential tasks or as independent, parallel tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework called EARL, which performs entity linking and relation linking as a joint task. EARL implements two different solution strategies for which we provide a comparative analysis in this paper: The first strategy is a formalization of the joint entity and relation linking tasks as an instance of the Generalised Travelling Salesman Problem (GTSP). In order to be computationally feasible, we employ approximate GTSP solvers. The second strategy uses machine learning in order to exploit the connection density between nodes in the knowledge graph. It relies on three base features and re-ranking steps in order to predict entities and relations. We compare the strategies and evaluate them on a dataset with 5000 questions. Both strategies significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art approaches for entity and relation linking. 

"[Assessing Linked Data Versioning Systems: The Semantic Publishing Versioning Benchmark](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2179/SSWS2018_paper4.pdf)"

Vassilis Papakonstantinou, Irini Fundulaki and Giorgos Flouris, presented at 12th International Workshop on Scalable Semantic Web Knowledge Base Systems (SSWS 2018). Also appeared in "Emerging Topics in Semantic Technologies. ISWC 2018 Satellite Events" with AKA Verlag, since had been selected as one of the best papers of SSWS 2018. 

Abstract. As the Linked Open Data Cloud is constantly evolving, both at schema and instance level, there is a need for systems that efficiently support storing and querying of such data. However, there is a limited number of such systems and even fewer benchmarks that test their performance. In this paper, we describe in detail the Semantic Publishing Versioning Benchmark (SPVB) that aims to test the ability of versioning systems to efficiently manage versioned Linked Data datasets and queries evaluated on top of these datasets. We discuss the benchmark data and SPARQL query generation process, as well as the evaluation methodology we followed for assessing the performance of a benchmarked system. Finally, we describe a set of experiments conducted with the R43ples and Virtuoso systems using SPVB.

Description: This workshop is a joint event of two active communities in the area of interaction paradigms to Linked Data: NLIWOD4 and QALD-9. NLIWOD, a workshop for discussions on the advancement of natural language interfaces to the Web of Data, has been organized three-times within ISWC, with a focus on soliciting discussions on the development of question answering systems. QALD is a benchmarking campaign powered by the H2020 project HOBBIT (project-hobbit.eu) including question answering over (Big) linked data, and has been organized as a challenge within CLEF, ESWC and ISWC. This joint workshop hopes to attract people from the two communities in order to promote active collaboration, to extend the scope of currently addressed topics, and to foster the reuse of resources developed so far. Furthermore, we offer a challenge - QALD-9 - where users are free to demonstrate the capabilities of their systems using the provided online benchmark platform. Furthermore, we want to broaden the scope of this workshop series to dialogue systems and chatbots as increasingly important business intelligence factors.

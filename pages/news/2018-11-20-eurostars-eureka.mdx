DIESEL has developed several, generic keyword search and question answering systems for distributed and structured enterprise data. Our framework exploits the distribution of the data to improve both the interpretation and the federated execution of user queries while abiding by the users’ access restrictions. We delivered an open-source version of the framework that implements keyword search functionality as well as prototypical extensions of the partners’ product suites and use case studies.  
  
The final prototype can be found at [http://genesis-diesel.aksw.org](http://genesis-diesel.aksw.org/)  
  
In total, DIESEL supported the publication of 32 high-quality papers as well as several large open source projects which can be found at [https://github.com/dice-group/](https://github.com/dice-group/)

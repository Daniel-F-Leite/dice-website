DILS (Data Integration in the Life Sciences) Post-Conference workshop on Open Research Knowledge Graphs ([https://projects.tib.eu/orkg/](https://projects.tib.eu/orkg/))  
More than 50 attendees attended the 2nd Open Research Knowledge Graph workshop ([https://events.tib.eu/dils2018/programme/post-conference/](https://events.tib.eu/dils2018/programme/post-conference/)) at TIB (Technische Informationsbibliothek Hannover) on November 22nd 2018.  
  
**Introduction by Sören Auer & Markus Stocker**  
Sören introduced the scholarly communication shift using the example of moving from printed encyclopedias and mail catalogs to HTML-based digital publication chains and briefly touched on the topic of Project DEAL (http://projekt-deal.de). Among other topics, Sören showed how 'Question Answering' techniques based on Knowledge Graphs can help to find more concise answers by providing a natural way to interact with the vast amounts of data available in libraries. Thus, there is a need for (Open Research Knowledge Graphs) ORKGs.  
  
**Keynote: Knowledge Graphs in Life Sciences by Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann**  
([https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=mftO-hEAAAAJ&hl=de](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=mftO-hEAAAAJ&hl=de))  
  
Professor Rebholz-Schuhmann, a medical doctor and computer scientist, and currently the director of ZB.MED, pointed out several technological challenges of ORKGs, e.g., retrieval performance, uptime, complexity of queries. The main takeaway from his presentation was: "Get the databases in tune. Getting the semantics in tune is even harder". However, in his outlook, he envisions the growth of semantics in the life sciences.  
  
**Recent ORKG developments by Markus Stocker**  
The Open Research Knowledge Graph (http://orkg.org) focusses currently on communicated content than on the context, i.e., metadata. The goal is a fine-grained detail level for research data, e.g., to capture single entries in tables. Markus suggests simple forms as input possibilities (maybe when submitting to a journal of a conference). The current ORKG UI resembles crowd-sourced approaches similar to Wikidata. Although it is only a prototype, it already pleased most people in the audience. Speak to Markus ([http://markusstocker.com/](http://markusstocker.com/)) if you have ideas or students interested in working on ORKGs.

  
**ORKG DILS Experiment Report by Viktor Kovtun**  
At the DILS conference ([https://events.tib.eu/dils2018/](https://events.tib.eu/dils2018/)), the first experiment with the new ORKG prototype was carried out. Conference attendees were asked to annotate a paper. On average, it took them 17mins and resulted in over 400 statements across a dozen publications. The conclusion from the researchers was that there is still a long way to go but the pursuit is worthwhile.  
  
After 5 stimulus talks, the day continued with work in parallel working groups, which dug deeper into different aspects, such as architecture, stakeholders, use cases and funding.  
  
We encourage all researchers to closely follow the ORKG development process.

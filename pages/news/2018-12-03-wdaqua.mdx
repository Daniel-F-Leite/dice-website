On Thursday, December 13th 2018, the closing event of the [WDAqua](http://wdaqua.eu/) highlighted the achievements of the past 3 years. The German National Library of Science and Technology (short TIB) served once again as a fabulous host institution.  
  
After a warm welcome, Sören Auer introduced his [ERC project ScienceGraph](https://www.l3s.de/en/content/erc-consolidator-grant-prof-auer) and pitched a ground-breaking idea on how to publish in the future.  
  
Several Ph.D. students showed their impressive progress in this International Training Network program, including [Kuldeep Singh](https://oyekuldeep.wordpress.com/), [Harsh Thakkar](http://sda.cs.uni-bonn.de/people/harsh-thakkar/), and [Lucie-Aimée Kaffee](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/lafk1d16) among others. Next, to the large bundle of new ideas, this meeting served as a focal point for future collaborations in the areas of Question Answering and Dialogue Systems.

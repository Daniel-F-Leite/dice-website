The EU project “Holistic Benchmarking of Big Linked Data” was completed on November 31st, 2018. During the last 36 months, 9 partners coordinated their efforts in the area of benchmarking Linked data Systems and achieved unprecedented results:

- We created the first holistic benchmarking platform for benchmarking Big Linked Data solutions in a distributed environment. The online instance of the HOBBIT platform now runs on a server cluster and was used by more than 200 users for more than 12k experiments (see [^1]). The platform offers a whole gamut of features required by industrial and academic users, ranging from the support of evaluation challenges to the flexible deployment of benchmarks and systems in distributed environments such as the Amazon Cloud. 
- We created benchmarks which cover most of the lifecycle of Big Linked Data, including 
    - Generation and acquisition from streams of unstructured data
    - Generation and acquisition from streams of semi-structured data
    - Link discovery
    - Structured machine learning
    - Linked data storage
    - Linked data versioning
    - Question answering
    - Faceted browsing

Third parties added more benchmarks to this list, leading to over 40 benchmarks being adopted into the platform.

- During the project, more than 10 benchmarking challenges were carried out, including the DEBS Grand Challenges 2017 and 2018, the MOCHA challenges 2017 and 2018, the OAIE challenges 2017 and 2018, the OKE challenges 2017 and 2018 as well as the QALD and SQA challenges [^2]. 

We are proud to have achieved all the goals of the HOBBIT project. Although the project itself is over, the research in this area has just begun. The project partners joined the Special group 7 under Task Force 6 of the Big Data Value Association to continue pushing forward the development of Big Linked Data solutions and their benchmarking.

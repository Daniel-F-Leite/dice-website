The research project investigates whether voice-controlled situational information can be usefully used by staff and emergency forces in civil protection. Visitors can try out the latest research results for themselves at the BMBF stand (stand no. 29). Employees of the project partners PRO DV AG, Aristech GmbH, Universität Paderborn and Universität Bonn are available for information and discussion.

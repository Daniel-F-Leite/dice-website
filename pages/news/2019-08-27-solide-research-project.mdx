The SOLIDE research project showed its current progress live at the BMBF stand through many conversations. The visitors particularly appreciated the advantages and possibilities that a natural-language dialogue opens up: fast, natural-looking information retrieval, easy handling and free hands for other activities. The wish for a dictation function for entries in the logbook, facts, etc. was expressed several times. The SOLIDE research project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

It has been a great experience attending the 10th Knowledge Capture (KCAP) conference as one of the top-tier conferences in knowledge representation and semantics computing. This year, [KCAP2019](https://www.k-cap.org/2019/index.html) was in Marina del Rey, California. It received 104 valid submissions (89 long papers, 15 short papers). Our research group (DICE) had 5 accepted papers from 11 submissions.

Day one/Tuesday:

On the first day of the conference (19th November), there were different tutorials and workshops related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and hybrid questions answering. I enjoyed the presentations by Mr. Jose Manuel about hybrid techniques for knowledge-based NLP. It gave me insights about incorporating pre-trained language models and external knowledge graphs in text processing.

  

In the evening, I was happy to present my paper [“Jointly Learning from Social Media and Environmental Data for Typhoon Intensity Prediction”](https://papers.dice-research.org/2019/K-CAP19_Joint-model/K-CAP19_Joint-model-public.pdf), about the research I completed in my first-year PhD. In particular, we explore how to leverage social media posts to improve disaster operations during emergencies.

Day two/Wednesday:

  

The second day started with the session “Towards Machines that Capture and Reason with Science” by Mr. Peter Clark from Allen Institute for AI. Mr. Peter gave us a general overview about the research at the Institute.

  

In the afternoon session, I presented an accepted research track paper of my college Abdullah F. Ahmed (who couldn’t attend the conference, because of his USA visa rejection). The title of his paper is [“Do your Resources Sound Similar? On the Impact of Using Phonetic Similarity in Link Discovery”](https://papers.dice-research.org/2019/K-cap-2019_Phonetic_simialrity/public.pdf). The authors study the impact of phonetics similarity in discovering links among resources in different RDF datasets.

Day Three/Thursday:

  

On the last day of the conference, I had the opportunity to meet researchers from different institutes, and discussed with them some interesting papers presented at the conference.

  

KCAP2019 was the first conference I have ever attended. Personally, I think it was well organized and very successful. I fully enjoyed and learned a lot from the presented tutorials and research papers. KCAP2019 helped me to focus on further research directions, especially in knowledge graphs (construction, completion and transfer learning).

  
  

Thank You!.

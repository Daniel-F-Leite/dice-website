Simple text-based search systems do not reflect the semantics of individual input words of search queries. For example, a query for the word “house” would not return records for the words “building” or “real estate”. How can such relationships be represented in a technical system? One approach is to include synonyms. Search engines like Elasticsearch provide methods to integrate synonym lists. However, a list of synonyms itself is required for configuration.

## Synonyms in knowledge graphs

There are several knowledge graphs that contain synonyms. The Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud (LingHub) describes corresponding datasets. The following list shows a selection of linguistic knowledge graphs and their limitations:

  

-   [BabelNet](https://babelnet.org/download) ([Limits in API requests](https://babelnet.org/guide))
    
-   [DBnary](http://kaiko.getalp.org/) (Multilingual. Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0)
    
-   [RDF/OWL Representation of WordNet](https://www.w3.org/TR/wordnet-rdf/) (Limited to English)
    
-   [LingHub](http://linghub.org/) lists further data sources

## Extracting synonyms from DBnary

To extract synonyms out of a knowledge graph, the underlying ontology has to be first understood. The following figure shows the part of the ontology required for the extraction of synonyms in the German language:

With knowledge of the required DBnary data structures, a SPARQL query can now be formulated. An execution of the following example will return 100 entries for German synonyms. The query can be tested using the SPARQL endpoint at [http://kaiko.getalp.org/sparql](http://kaiko.getalp.org/sparql).

  
```
SELECT DISTINCT ?germannoun ?synonym WHERE {
?n a <http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/2.0/lexinfo#Noun> .
?n <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/lime#language> "de" .
?n <http://kaiko.getalp.org/dbnary#synonym> ?p .
?p <http://kaiko.getalp.org/dbnary#describes> ?n2 .
?n2 a <http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/2.0/lexinfo#Noun> .
?n <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#canonicalForm> ?c .
?c <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#writtenRep> ?germannoun .
?n2 <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#canonicalForm> ?c2 .
?c2 <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#writtenRep> ?synonym .
}
LIMIT 100
OFFSET 0
```

Listing: SPARQL request



  
In a test run, we extracted 6,668 nouns in German and 21,634 corresponding synonyms. As a final step, the synonym list can be used to configure search engines and thus improve the findability of data records.

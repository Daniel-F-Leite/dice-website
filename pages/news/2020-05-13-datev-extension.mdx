We have recently extended our research cooperation with [DATEV eG](https://www.datev.de). The collaboration is taking place since more than a year. It includes regular meetings with the research team at DATEV eG to exchange ideas about research topics and technologies. In addition, we are working together in research projects, such as the [SPEAKER](https://www.speaker.fraunhofer.de) project. We are also collaborating in submitting proposals for research topics.

We have recently extended our research cooperation with [DATEV eG](https://www.datev.de). The collaboration is taking place since more than a year. It includes regular meetings with the research team at DATEV eG to exchange ideas about research topics and technologies. In addition, we are working together in research projects, such as the nationally funded project [SPEAKER](https://www.speaker.fraunhofer.de). We are also collaborating in writing and submitting proposals.

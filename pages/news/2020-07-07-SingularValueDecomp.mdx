On 16.06.2020, searching “singular value decomposition'' in Google yielded 22.6 106 results while searching “Alan Turing” in Google yielded 16 106 results. The magnitude of the discrepancy between the number of retrieved results may be enough to indicate the importance of singular value decomposition (SVD). In this short blog post, we aim to share the beauty of SVD with readers by providing a brief theoretical background followed by Python implementation.

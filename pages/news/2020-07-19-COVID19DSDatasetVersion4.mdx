The Dice research group are happy to present version 4 of our Covid-19-related research publication dataset, dubbed COVID-19-DS. 
Our new version includes the following updates and new features:
 - We added to our dataset all the newly added resources in the last releases of the [CORD-19](https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19/download).
- Compared to the previous version, the dataset increased by 33%.
- The data is represented in one archive and it is no longer divided by three parts (commercial, non-commercial, custom license), as in the original data from the [CORD-19](https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/historical_releases.html).
- Bib entries were linked with papers using *cvdo:hasPublication*.
- Our publications were linked to MAKG Publications using *owl:sameAs*.
- The number of links increased respectively to other changes that had been applied (i.e., 400K+ more links). 
- The ontology was expanded (see the UML class diagram of the Covid-19-DS Ontology).
 
The following tables show the statistics between two versions (previous and current one):

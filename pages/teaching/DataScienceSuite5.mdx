## Content

The Data Science Suite PG aims at covering the linked data lifecycle from gathering (e.g., crawling) data, over extracting structured information, indexing and storing the structured data as well as cleaning and checking the data before presenting it to the user in an interactive way. Since the PG covers several fields, we offer several sub topics which are covered by smaller groups.

The single subgroups that we plan to offer during the next semester as well as the evaluation criterias for participating students can be found [on our slides](https://hobbitdata.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/teaching/projectgroups/WiSe2020/00_topics.pdf) (Note that both is not final and might be subject to change).

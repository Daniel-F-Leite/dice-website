## Content

Knowledge graphs represent structured collections of assertions about the world.
Deep learning models have been effectively applied to tackle various graph-related problems.
Yet, their predictions are often at most post-hoc and locally explainable.
In contrast, predictions of description logic concept learning models are ante-hoc and globally explainable.
Although most knowledge graphs evolve with the time, previous works mostly focused on static knowledge graphs.
The goal of this project group is to design algorithms that learn description logic concepts from examples
on dynamic knowledge graphs.

## Content

Most humans are facing a flood of information every day. However, not every news people read or every fact they are told is actually true. To this end, an automated check of information is needed. The goal of this lecture is to provide students with sinights in Fact Checking approaches. The lecture is structured as follows:

1. Preliminaries
2. Text-based approaches
3. Knowledge-graph-based approaches
4. Hybrid approaches

## Structure

The course consists of:

1. **A lecture**
   The course comprises 2 90min lectures
2. **A lab**
   Students are invited to gather practical experiences with SPARQL queries and knowledge-graphs. After that, they should extend the knowledge-graph-based Fact Checking system COPAAL.

## Lab material 

* TODO add a link to the DBPedia SPARQL endpoint
* [COPAAL](https://github.com/dice-group/COPAAL) is an open-source knowledge-graph-based Fact Checking system

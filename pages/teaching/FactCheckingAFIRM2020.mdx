## Content
The goal of this lecture is to present some of the fundamental algorithms on pertaining to fact checking. We will begin with a short introduction to knowledge graphs. Thereafter, we will delve into text-based and graph-based solutions to the fact checking problem. Finally, hybrid solutions will be presented.

## Structure

The course consists of:

1. **A lecture**
   The course comprises 2 x 90min lectures
2. **A lab**
   Students are invited to gather practical experiences with SPARQL queries and knowledge-graphs. After that, they should extend the knowledge-graph-based Fact Checking system COPAAL.

## Lab material 

* DBPedia SPARQL endpoint
    * [official endpoint](http://dbpedia.org/sparql)
    * [DICE hosted endpoint](http://sparql.cs.uni-paderborn.de:8891/)
* [COPAAL](https://github.com/dice-group/COPAAL) is an open-source knowledge-graph-based Fact Checking system

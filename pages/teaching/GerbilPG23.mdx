## An extension of the GERBIL benchmarking platform

<img src="https://hobbitdata.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/gerbil/gerbil_logo.png" alt="GERBIL logo" width="200"/>

GERBIL is a benchmarking platform. Originally developed for benchmarking [knowledge extraction systems](https://github.com/dice-group/gerbil), it emerged into a platform that is used to benchmark [question answering](https://github.com/dice-group/gerbil/tree/QuestionAnswering), [fact validation](https://github.com/dice-group/gerbil/tree/KBC) and [machine translation](https://github.com/dice-group/BENG) systems as well. However, this let to a situation in which branches started to diverge and updates have to be applied to one branch after the other. Hence, the first goal of this PG is to merge all these GERBIL versions into one single GERBIL that comprises a task independent core and task dependent modules. The second goal is to use this core to implement an extension of GERBIL for benchmarking knowledge graph embedding algorithms.

* Create a generic GERBIL framework that is not bound to a particular set of tasks.
* Use the previously created generic framework to develop a new GEBRIL instance for knowledge graph embeddings

#### Question & Answer Session

Q: Will there be prior assignments? What would these assignments look like?<br/>
A: Yes, there will be assignments to ensure that participants are able to program in Java. To this end, the assignments will be simple Java programming tasks.

Q: Is there a seminar connected to this PG?<br/>
A: No.

Q: What are the prerequisites for this PG?<br/>
A: You should be able to program in Java. Knowledge about RDF, knowledge graphs, embedding algorithms and software design principles is beneficial.

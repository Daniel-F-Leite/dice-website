The goal of this Project Group is to develop a sytem, that creates natural language text from Knowledge Graph triples.
[LD2NL](https://github.com/dice-group/LD2NL)

In general this contains the steps:
* Document Planning
* Micro Planning
* Linguistic Reasoning

Furthermore the output texts from the system should be evaluated. For that the GERBIL system (http://gerbil-qa.aksw.org/gerbil/ ) should be used.

#### Question & Answer Session

Q: Will there be prior assignments? What would these assignments look like?<br/>
A: Yes, there will be assignments to ensure that participants are able to implement the required components. To this end, the assignments will contain some general questions and a programming task in Python.

Q: Is there a seminar connected to this PG?<br/>
A: No.

Q: What are the prerequisites for this PG?<br/>
A: You should be able to program in Python. Knowledge about Java Programming Language RDF, Knowledge Graphs, Natural Language processing and Machine Learning are beneficial. If you don't know these things you will have to study it at the beginning of the PG. Unfortunately, there won't be the time to give an introduction into these topics.

ORCA is a system for benchmarking Linked Data crawlers. More information about the benchmark can be found in the [IEEE ICSC paper](https://papers.dice-research.org/2021/ICSC2021_ORCA/ORCA_public.pdf). The code base can be found [on github](https://github.com/dice-group/orca).

The goal of the PG is to extend the benchmark by adding more features. Some of these features are (in no particular order):

* Add checks for embedded RDF data (Microformat, Microdata, JSON-LD).
* Add more compressions (especially HDT).
* Incorporate existing RDF generators.

The topic is briefly explained in [the slides](https://hobbitdata.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/dice-website/pgs/PG_presentations_SS_2021.pdf) that have been used during the presentation of the project groups on February 15th.

rdf4cpp aims to be a stable, modern RDF library for C++ for the W3C standard [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/).

The goal of the PG is to extend the framework draft at https://github.com/rdf4cpp/rdf4cpp to a fully featured RDF library. 
Some of the features that are being implemented are:

* Full support for XSD datatypes
* Support for unary and binary filter functions on RDF resources alike [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) filters
* SPARQL parsing and simple query processing
* unit and integration tests

#### Question & Answer Session

Q: Will there be prior assignments? What would these assignments look like?<br/>
A: Yes, there will be assignments to ensure that participants are able to program in C++. To this end, the assignments will be simple C++ programming tasks.

Q: Is there a seminar connected to this PG?<br/>
A: No.

Q: What are the prerequisites for this PG?<br/>
A: You should be able to program in C++20. Knowledge about RDF, knowledge graphs and/or graph theory are beneficial. If you don't know these things you will have to study it at the beginning of the PG. Unfortunately, there won't be the time to give an introduction into these topics.

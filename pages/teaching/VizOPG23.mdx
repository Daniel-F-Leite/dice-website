## Visualizing and Verbalizing Class Expressions

With the ever-growing generation of data for the Semantic Web comes an increasing demand for this data to be made available to non-semantic Web experts.
This non-trial goal can be achieved by (1) visualizing class expressions or (2) translating class expressions into natural language.
Although [LD2NL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01248.pdf) ([github-repo](https://github.com/dice-group/LD2NL)) can be used for (2), there are no tools developed for (1).
The goal of this project is to 
+ Create a web application that receives inputs containing class expressions and additional data (e.g. F1 score). 
Such inputs are visualized, verbalized and shown to users. By this, users are informed about the current process of class expression problem in a fashion akin to the [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard).

2. Integrate this web application into one of our existing frameworks, e.g. [ontolearn](https://github.com/dice-group/Ontolearn) or [DRILL](https://github.com/dice-group/DRILL).

# Topic 

Hyperparameter optimization plays an important role in different domains of machine learning.
Recently, [Ruffinelli et al.](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkxSmlBFvr) shows that appropriately training and optimization knowledge graph embedding models often shrinks and sometimes even reverses when compared to prior results. 
Yet, given a dataset, finding a suitable embedding model and optimizing it is not a trivial task.
In this thesis, the student will closely work on AutoML and possible integration into our [dice-embeddings](https://github.com/dice-group/dice-embeddings).

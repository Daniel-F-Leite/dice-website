This thesis will investigate how good is the query plan generated by the underlying cost-based distributed SPARQL engine in terms of the relative error.  The relative error is a performance measure which tell how accurate is the estimated result size of the triple patterns or joins between triple patterns. The more accurate estimation leads to better query execution time.

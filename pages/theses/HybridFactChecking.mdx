In the semantic web, every triple is handled as a true fact. However, in the time of fake news, this does not have to hold. Therefore, the area of Fact Checking is developing approaches to check single facts. 

At the moment, there are two distinct approaches for that. Either, a system searches for textual evidences or it tries to find evidences in a given knowledge base. In this thesis, the student should combine these two approaches. A possible combination could be to find paths that are expected to be in the knowledge base if the fact is true. If the paths can not be found because single triples are missing, a textual Fact Checking system could be used to search for evidences for this single, missing fact.

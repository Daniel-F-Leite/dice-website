In the semantic web, every triple is handled as a true fact. However, in the time of fake news, this does not have to hold. Therefore, the area of Fact Checking is developing approaches to check single facts. 

In this thesis, the student should develop an approach to check the veracity of a complete Knowledge Base. However, Knowledge Bases can become huge and checking every single fact would be too time consuming. Therefore, an approach has to be developed to determine central statements of the Knowledge Base which can be used for checking.

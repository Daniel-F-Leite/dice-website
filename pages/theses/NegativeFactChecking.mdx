In the semantic web, every triple is handled as a true fact. However, in the time of fake news, this does not have to hold. Therefore, the area of Fact Checking is developing approaches to check single facts. 

We developed FactCheck, an approach that searches for evidences of a fact in a given corpus. However, at the moment, FactCheck is taking only evidences into account which prove the given fact. In this thesis, the student should extend FactCheck to enable it to find refuting textual evidences in a given text corpus.

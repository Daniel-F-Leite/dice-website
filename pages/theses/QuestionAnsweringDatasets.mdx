Currently, there are more than 30 datasets from over 20 years research. All these datasets are in different formats and forms and their Question-Answer pairs can only be answered on specific underlying datasets.

In this thesis, the student will analyse the features of all these datasets and propose a solution to lift and access this benchmark to 5-star data (http://5stardata.info/en/). Answers will be grounded in knowledge bases via machine learning methods. Finally, the lifted datasets will be integrated into the renowned framework, GERBIL QA (http://gerbil-qa.aksw.org/gerbil/).

For evaluating the efficiency and scalability of knowledge-graph processing systems (e.g., storage solutions), large knowledge graphs are needed. However, graphs available for this kind of evaluation may not have the necessary size. At the same time, graph generators exist, but are typically limited to a certain domain or graph structure. Hence, an approach to mimik real-world knowledge graphs is needed, which enables users to generate graphs of an arbitrary size with the features of a given real-world knowledge graph.

Lemming is a system for mimicking real-world knowledge graphs. However, it is bound to the usage of several versions of a given knowledge graph. More information about the system can be found in the [IEEE ICSC paper](https://papers.dice-research.org/2021/ICSC2021_Lemming/Lemming_public.pdf). The code base can be found [on github](https://github.com/dice-group/Lemming).

The goal of this thesis is to create an approach for mimiking a real-world knowledge graph without using several versions of this graph. Instead, only a single graph is taken as input. This graph is analyzed with respect to small graph structures found within the graph (so called simplexes). After that, the gathered statistics are used to generate a new graph which has a similar simplex distribution. The evaluation of the approach will be carried out in a similar setup as the evaluation for LEMMING (see publication linked above).

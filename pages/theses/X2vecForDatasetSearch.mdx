A central aim of linked data is to interlink datasets. Therefore, a newly created dataset should be linked to existing datasets. Since no user can have an overview over thousands of existing datasets, search engines like [Tapioca](http://aksw.org/Projects/Tapioca.html) exist to retrieve datasets that might be candidates for links for a given dataset.

For this thesis, the student should get an overview over the different X2vec methods that exist to transform a given RDF dataset into a vector representation. This representation should be used for calculating similarity values to other, indexed datasets as done with Tapioca.

For several applications, knowledge graphs are transformed into a vector-based representation in an embedding space. These representations have the disadvantage that they comprise a large number of vectors with several hundred dimensions. A common task is to provide the k nearest neighbors for a given vector. There are several approaches which tackle this task. Some of them give an exact result while others provide a fast but approximate solution.

The [ANN Benchmarks project](http://ann-benchmarks.com/) provides a framework to benchmark a large number of existing solutions. However, a lot of these approaches have several parameters. Hence, the optimization of these parameters is an important task.

The goal of this thesis is to evaluate these approaches on several knowledge graph embedding models. Whenever parameters have to be optimized, a bayesian optimizer should be used. Please note that repeatability of the experiments is of very high importance.
